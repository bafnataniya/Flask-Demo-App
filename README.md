# Flask Stopwatch App

A simple stopwatch application built with **Flask**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This app allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer, demonstrating basic web development with Flask for serving a static page and JavaScript for handling the stopwatch functionality.

## Features:
- **Start Button**: Starts the stopwatch and begins counting the time in seconds.
- **Stop Button**: Pauses the timer at the current time.
- **Reset Button**: Resets the timer back to 00:00.

## Technologies Used:
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework for serving the app and handling routes.
- **HTML**: Markup language to structure the page content.
- **CSS**: Styles to create a clean, responsive, and modern user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the stopwatch logic (Start, Stop, Reset).
